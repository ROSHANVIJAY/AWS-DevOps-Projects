ðŸš€ ðŸŽ‰DevOps Project-06 - build Infrastructure using Terraform

ðŸŒŸ Key Takeaways:
1. Terraform Use-Cases: Explored how Terraform streamlines infrastructure provisioning, management, and scaling on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

2. Terraform Life Cycle: Learned the stages - planning, applying, and destroying - crucial for orchestrating changes in infrastructure.

3. Writing Your First Terraform Project: Created an EC2 instance using Terraform scripts, diving into provider configurations, resource definitions, and more.

4. Terraform State File, Variables, Inputs, Outputs: Explored vital files like `variable.tf`, `input.tf`, `output.tf`, and the Terraform state file, understanding their roles in managing infrastructure as code.

5. Terraform Best Practices: Delved into organizing code into reusable modules, version control, state management, and other best practices for efficient infrastructure automation.
